pps-gen-gpio
============

Linux kernel PPS generator using GPIO pins.

In kernel 5.4 there is no support for using a GPIO pin as a PPS generator, only a GPIO PPS client is available. This driver is derived from the current parallel port PPS generator and provides a PPS signal through a GPIO pin specified in the device tree. The PPS signal is synchronized to the tv_sec increment of the wall clock.

We have tested the driver with kernel 5.4.152 on a Beaglebone Black where P9 pin 16 (GPIO1_19) is used as PPS output. The corresponding modified device tree file is here shown.

Usage
-----
If you use a Beaglebone Black and want to change the PPS output pin, you have to modify your device tree file (am335x-boneblack.dts) accordingly:
- Make sure you have the right pin multiplexing setting:

		pps_gen_pins: pinmux_pps_gen_pins {
			pinctrl-single,pins = <
				0x4C (PIN_OUTPUT_PULLDOWN | MUX_MODE7) /* gpmc_a3.gpio1_19 */

Check the [BBB System Reference Manual](https://github.com/CircuitCo/BeagleBone-Black/blob/master/BBB_SRM.pdf?raw=true) and the [am335x Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/ug/spruh73q/spruh73q.pdf) to find out the correct pinmux table offset of the chosen pin.
- The pps-gen-gpios property defines the pin you want to use as a PPS output:

		pps-gen {
				pinctrl-names = "default";
				pinctrl-0 = <&pps_gen_pins>;
				compatible = "pps-gen-gpio";
				pps-gen-gpio = <&gpio1 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
				default-state = "off";

Please note that in order to use the module with any other board using the device tree infrastructure, the following matching definitions are required in the device tree:

		pps-gen               node defined for the PPS GPIO
		pps-gen-gpio          value of ".compatible" property in pps-gen node
		pps-gen-gpio          property in pps-gen node that defines which GPIO pin is used

After modifying the device tree, add the files into drivers/pps/generators and configure the driver to be built as a module. You need to enable PPS support in the kernel.
